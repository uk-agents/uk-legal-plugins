description: >
  Run a focused N-question study session on a subject — SQE1-style MCQ,
  essay, or flashcards. Tracks performance and updates the study plan. Use
  when the user says "run me 10 questions on [subject]", "do a session on
  [subject]", "let's do 5 cards on [subject]", or wants to drill a fixed
  number of questions and have the plan adapt.

# /law-student-uk:session

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` — subject and N. If missing, ask:
   > What subject, and how many questions? (e.g., `Land Law 10` or `Contract 5 --essay`.)
2. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/uk-legal-plugins/law-student-uk/CLAUDE.md` → qualification route, exam format, weak subjects.
3. Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/uk-legal-plugins/law-student-uk/study-plan.yaml` if it exists. Read `session_history` for this subject to weight subtopics toward where the student has been weak.
4. Route by method flag:
   - `--sqe1` (default for SQE1 subjects): load `bar-prep-questions` skill, run N SQE1-style single-best-answer questions. Apply jurisdiction handling (see that skill's `## Jurisdiction handling`). Label each `[E&W]` or `[Scots law]` as appropriate.
   - `--essay`: load `bar-prep-questions`, run N problem question or essay prompts. Grade per essay-mode rubric.
   - `--flashcards`: load `flashcards` skill, run N cards in `--drill` mode.
5. Run N questions one at a time. After each, explain right/wrong and flag rule-body when jurisdictions diverge.
6. At session end, write session results:
   - If `study-plan.yaml` exists: append to `session_history` per the schema in the `study-plan` skill.
   - If not: write to `~/.claude/plugins/config/uk-legal-plugins/law-student-uk/session-history.yaml`.
7. Report:
   - Score: X/N (percentage)
   - Missed: list with subtopic tags
   - Weak subtopics this session
   - Pattern vs. prior sessions on this subject (if history has 2+ prior)
   - What the plan now recommends next
